# CR2032-TABBED-HOR-3POS-replacement-holder

This is a replacement battery holder for the 3V battery inside the 1985-1987 Korg DW-8000 synthesizer keyboard. This battery holder allows for easier swaps of common CR2032 3V lithium coin batteries. It requires a small paperclip cut into two lengths to act as the pins and pressure contacts of the battery holder.

The battery keeps the sound patches in memory, but without this backup current, the RAM loses the sound patches and the keyboard is generally unusable by itself, except as a MIDI keyboard.

The original factory-installed battery lasted about 10 years if the keyboard was rarely used. The original battery was directly soldered into the main PCB and requires skilled de-soldering and soldering to remove and replace.

The unique battery holder shape avoids interference with nearby components on the board that would otherwise prevent off-the-shelf battery holders from being installed in the original battery location; because this design uses the existing holes for the battery terminals, it avoids the need for other electrical modifications to relocate existing components elsewhere.

Skilled de-soldering and re-soldering is still required for this battery holder, but if done correctly it should only have to be done this once! Use clippers to remove the original battery from the circuit board, then use solder cleanup techniques to remove the pins left behind and remove any excess solder. A copper wick desoldering technique works well, and a 0.7mm paperclip can be used as a sort of pipe-cleaner to prepare the through holes (3 of them) for the paperclip-pins that will be used as the battery contacts.

Note: A paperclip with a wire diameter of about 0.7mm to 0.8mm is used with this battery holder as the battery contacts. The three battery holes on the PCB accept pins with about 0.8mm diameter. The paperclip is cut into two lengths which are then bent to fit within the channels of the battery holder to make the + and - contacts with the battery and act as the pins through the PCB. The + length of paperclip also acts as a retainer for the coin battery.

!!! Solder the paperclips to the PCB without the holder in place, as the plastic will melt !!!
